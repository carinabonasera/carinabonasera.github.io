<p> I am currently a second-year journalism and science/environmental writing major at Lehigh University. I am a member of Alpha Gamma Delta, Zeta Beta chapter. At Lehigh I work as an editorial assistant in the Office of Development and Alumni Relations, where I am mainly responsible for writing and editing stories, in addition to some other tasks.
  Outside of school I love to box at my gym, watch feel-good shows like <i>Friends</i> and <i>How I Met Your Mother,</i> and dream about the day that I finally swim with sharks. 
      
      Here is a bit more about me, as shown through a cartoon format!
      </p>

      <h2>Map</h2>
      <p> Google fusion tables make it possible to create interactive "slippy" maps, in which viewers can zoom, drag, and click on content for a more detailed look. Take a look at one that I created about my hometown, Bucks County, PA.
