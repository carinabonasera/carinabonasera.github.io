<p> I am currently a second-year journalism and science/environmental writing major at Lehigh University. I am a member of Alpha Gamma Delta, Zeta Beta chapter. At Lehigh I work as an editorial assistant in the Office of Development and Alumni Relations, where I am mainly responsible for writing and editing stories.
  Outside of school I love to box at my gym, watch feel-good shows like <i>Friends</i> and <i>How I Met Your Mother,</i> and dream about the day that I finally swim with sharks. </p>
      
  <p2> Here is a bit more about me...</p2>

      <h3>My Experience in Data Visualization Class</h3>
      <p>While taking a Data Visualization class this past semester, I learned several techniques for creating beautiful and functional displays of information. In an increasingly media-based world, the ability to communicate information through visually appealing graphics is valuable.</p>
        <p><strong>Here are some examples of my work:</strong></p>
