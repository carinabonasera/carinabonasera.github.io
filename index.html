<p> I am currently a second-year journalism and science/environmental writing major at Lehigh University. I am a member of Alpha Gamma Delta, Zeta Beta chapter. At Lehigh I work as an editorial assistant in the Office of Development and Alumni Relations, where I am mainly responsible for writing and editing stories, in addition to some other tasks.
  Outside of school I love to box at my gym, watch feel-good shows like <i>Friends</i> and <i>How I Met Your Mother,</i> and dream about the day that I finally swim with sharks. 
      
      Here is a bit more about me, as shown through a cartoon format!

      <h3>Line Chart</h3>
  <p> Line charts are useful for comparing data to tell a story. Follow the link to see an example I created about Carbon emissions based on data from the United Nations.
